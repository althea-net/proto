//! This crate provides Gravity proto definitions in Rust and also re-exports cosmos_sdk_proto for use by downstream
//! crates. By default around a dozen proto files are generated and places into the prost folder. We could then proceed
//! to fix up all these files and use them as the required dependencies to the Gravity file, but we chose instead to replace
//! those paths with references ot upstream cosmos-sdk-proto and delete the other files. This reduces cruft in this repo even
//! if it does make for a somewhat more confusing proto generation process.
